# Images are signals!
And henceforth, sound!

## Current scheme:
### Instrument
Sampled rows -> tambre (waveform)

Sampled columns -> envelope


![Row 50](row_50.png "row 50")

![Row_1000](row_1000.png "row 1000")

Examples of wave forms from the 50th and 1000th rows of an image, respectively (notice how they can be very different?)

### Note
HSV Color [K-Means Clustering](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2014/05/26/opencv-python-k-means-color-clustering/)

H -> [Pitch](https://www.flutopedia.com/sound_color.htm)

S or V -> velocity

Perhaps have random selection for notes from the image? (So I don't really have to compose haha)

### Chords underneath
Find a chord progression from the note pool or something
